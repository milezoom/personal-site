Docker is very helpful when you need specific development environtment. Also if you don't want your OS become "dirty" because too many package installed. For my case, I use docker container to isolate environment to develop golang application. Then I use vscode remote to do coding inside the container. Here how I setup my golang dev env.  

## Dockerfile
To create container containing golang, I use base image minideb from bitnami, that based on debian.  
``` Dockerfile
FROM docker.io/bitnami/minideb:buster

RUN apt-get -y update && \
    apt-get -y install apt-utils iproute2 curl git login unzip procps build-essential && \
    curl -L -o /tmp/gosetup.tar.gz https://golang.org/dl/go1.16.5.linux-amd64.tar.gz && \
    tar -C /usr/local -xzf /tmp/gosetup.tar.gz && rm /tmp/gosetup.tar.gz && \
    export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin:/root/.go/bin && export GOPATH=/root/.go && \
    mkdir -p /app

ENV PATH="${PATH}:/usr/local/go/bin:/root/.go/bin"
ENV GOPATH="/root/.go"

WORKDIR /app

CMD tail -f /dev/null
```
Using script above, also installed several useful tools like curl, git, zip, and build-tools. Because I need version 1.16 and default version in os is 1.13, so I need to manually download from official golang site. I set my `GOPATH` at `/root/.go` and my `WORKDIR` (place to store my code) at `/app`. And finally I run tail at `/dev/null` to make container run forever.  

## docker-compose
Then after Dockerfile created, I create `docker-compose.yml` file.  
``` yaml
version: "3"

services:
  golang:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    image: golang:1.0.0
    container_name: golang
    volumes: 
      - golang-data:/app

volumes:
  golang-data:
```
For the container, I use docker volume that mounted to `/app` directory for data persistence. Put both files in one directory, then run `docker-compose up -d` to build and start the container.  

## connect VSCode to container
To connect vscode to container, use [remote container extension][1]. Then click remote connection button at bottom left, then select `Attach to Running Containerâ€¦`. A new window will open, and directory `/app` (according to specified `WORKDIR`) will be ready in file explorer. And for the integrated terminal, also mapped directly to `/app` directory.  

That's all, you can start code inside container using go SDK in the container from vscode.
